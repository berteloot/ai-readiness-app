# Security Improvements - Admin Endpoints

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements implemented to secure the admin endpoints that were previously wide open and vulnerable to unauthorized access.

## Previous Security Issues

### Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed
1. **No Authentication**: Admin endpoints were accessible without any authentication
2. **No Authorization**: Anyone could access sensitive data and perform destructive operations
3. **No Rate Limiting**: Endpoints could be abused for DoS attacks
4. **No Audit Logging**: No way to track who accessed what data
5. **Session Storage**: Used insecure sessionStorage for authentication state

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. JWT-Based Authentication
- **Implementation**: `src/lib/adminAuth.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Secure token generation using environment-based secret
  - 24-hour token expiration
  - Issuer and audience validation
  - Secure token verification

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **Implementation**: Built into `adminAuth.ts`
- **Configuration**:
  - 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP address
  - Automatic cleanup of expired rate limit records
  - Configurable limits via environment variables

### 3. Secure API Endpoints
All admin endpoints now require authentication:

- `GET /api/admin/users` - List all users
- `GET /api/admin/submissions` - List all submissions  
- `DELETE /api/admin/delete-user` - Delete user and submissions
- `DELETE /api/admin/submissions/[id]` - Delete individual submission
- `POST /api/admin/test-submission` - Create test data
- `GET /api/admin/test-db` - Test database connection

### 4. Audit Logging
- All admin actions are logged with user identification
- Logs include:
  - Admin user email
  - Action performed
  - Target resource (user ID, submission ID)
  - Timestamp
  - Success/failure status

### 5. Frontend Security
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage (more secure than sessionStorage)
- Automatic logout on token expiration
- Authorization headers included in all API calls
- Error handling for authentication failures

## Security Headers

All admin API calls now include:
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET=your-32+character-random-secret
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only authenticated admins can access endpoints
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (auth + rate limiting + logging)
3. **Secure Session Management**: JWT tokens with expiration
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated before processing
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak information
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all admin actions

## Testing Security

To test the security improvements:

1. **Without Authentication**:
   ```bash
   curl /api/admin/users
   # Should return 401 Unauthorized
   ```

2. **With Invalid Token**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token" /api/admin/users
   # Should return 401 Unauthorized
   ```

3. **With Valid Token**:
   ```bash
   # First get token via login
   curl -X POST /api/admin/login -d '{"password":"admin-password"}'
   # Then use token
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" /api/admin/users
   # Should return 200 OK with data
   ```

## Production Security Checklist

- [ ] Change default admin password
- [ ] Generate strong random session secret
- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Consider implementing IP whitelisting for admin access
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning

## Future Security Enhancements

1. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA for admin access
2. **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict admin access to specific IP ranges
3. **Session Management**: Add ability to revoke sessions
4. **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Implement Redis-based rate limiting
5. **Security Headers**: Add security headers middleware
6. **CORS Configuration**: Restrict CORS for admin endpoints

## Monitoring and Alerting

Monitor these security events:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Unusual admin activity patterns
- Token expiration and renewal
- Failed API calls with 401/403 status codes
